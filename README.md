# WeatherApp

I developed this App in one day time.
Here I used URLSession, RESTful API and animations.
The App follows MVVM Design pattern.

Libraries:
1. I used [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/) API all of my weather needs. I accessed current weather data  and 7 day / daily forecasts for any location including over 376,000 cities. 
2. I used [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android)
3. [ViewAnimator](https://github.com/marcosgriselli/ViewAnimator) packages and Core Animations to make animations also used URLSession for network data transfer tasks. 
4. I used SwiftyJSON(https://github.com/SwiftyJSON) to deal with JSOON Data.

When app starts, you can see city name, current temperature, sunrise, wind speed, rate of cloud, datetime (the city's own timezone) and weather forecast for 7 day. You can check the weather forecast of the city you want.
